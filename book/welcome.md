# Welcome

*Welcome to the written report of my master thesis.*

I'm Hannah Dienhart and this website contains my master thesis 
**FAIR modelling of enzyme kinetics by EnzymeML and Jupyter Notebooks** as a Jupyter Book.  
In the course of this thesis I developed many Jupyter Notebooks. 
Here you can find different Scenarios, visualising and modelling the data of some of the __EnzymeML__ project partners.

This Jupyter Book will automatically be converted to a LaTex file, which after a few small changes can be converted to the final pdf I will hand in. It won't contain this welcome page but start with the title page you can see below.
