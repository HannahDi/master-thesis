# Welcome

*Welcome to my master thesis.*

I'm Hannah Dienhart and this website contains my master thesis 
**FAIR modelling of enzyme kinetics by EnzymeML and Jupyter Notebooks** as Jupyter Book.  
In the course of this thesis I developed many Jupyter Notebooks. 
Here you can find 7 Scenarios, visualising and modelling the data of different project partners.

The final pdf of my master thesis will be automatically generated from this website, only excluding this introductory part. Below you see the tile page of the thesis.
