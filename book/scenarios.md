# Scenarios

In the course of my master thesis I worked in a team on the EnzymeML project in cooperation with project partners from other institutions. My colleague Simone Lauterbach was mainly tasked with organisation of the different projects, and helped with the creation of the EnzymeML documents. My main task was to take these EnzymeML documents and visualise and model their data in Jupyter Notebooks. In the following I included most of these Jupyter Notebooks containing scenarios which were developed in collaboration with several project partners. Among explanatory text these Jupyter Notebooks contain runnable code cells. On the website it is possible to run a Jupyter Notebook in a Binder session by clicking the `rocket button -> launch Binder`. Some parts of the Jupyter Notebooks are very repetitive, but I decided to include those so that each scenario is readable, executable and comprehensible by itself.
