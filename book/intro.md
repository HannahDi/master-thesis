# Introduction

Enzymology and biocatalysis are essential research fields and, like most others, are challenged with vast amounts of unsorted data and non-reproducible analysis. To tackle the data aspect, the format EnzymeML is being developed under the FAIR guidelines {cite}`fair_2016`. FAIR is an abbreviation for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and is a crucial part of today's research data management. To establish the use of EnzymeML in the community and prove its advantages, projects with experimentalists were started. They provided the data, which was converted into EnzymeML documents with the help of my colleague Simone Lauterbach. Within Jupyter Notebooks, I visualised and analysed the data, and we provided feedback to our project partners, thus tackling the second aspect, a reproducible analysis. Since EnzymeML is still actively developed, the Jupyter Notebooks were consistently updated.
